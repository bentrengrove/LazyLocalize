A simple Ruby gem for lazy Objective C developers who didn't add comments to their localized strings and have had a nice fellow team member add comments to the .strings file.

The gem extracts the comments from the .strings file and inserts it into the code files wherever it finds a blank comment with the same key.

Example usage:
	lazyLocalize *.m Resources/en.lproj/Localizable.strings
